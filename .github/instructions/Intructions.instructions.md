# Guidelines

- Only README.md and PLANNING.md are to be maintained as project documentation; remove or merge any other markdown files unless critical mds are explicitly required.

- When architecting any plan, carefully consider and plan for every edge case.

- Keep tasks as simple and straightforward as possible; avoid unnecessary complexity.

- Maintain a dedicated planning markdown file to continuously track your progress and plans.

- Monitor the terminal closely for any errors during execution.

- Prioritize fixing errors first based on user direction; you may skip lint warnings initially.

- Perform testing only after all other steps are completed.

- Update all relevant documentation and markdown files promptly after completing a task.

- Always update the PLANNING.md file to reflect the latest status after finishing a task.

- Maintain honesty and impartiality in all decision-making processes.

- Double-check your work thoroughly before marking any task as completed.
