			"taskTitle": "FERPA Compliance: Access Controls and Audit Logging",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down FERPA compliance implementation into: (1) access control enforcement, (2) audit logging middleware, (3) log storage schema, (4) log export/search features, (5) least privilege enforcement and endpoint review.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves regulatory compliance, robust access control, and comprehensive audit logging. It requires middleware integration, schema design, log management, and UI for log export/search. Testing must cover both authorized and unauthorized access scenarios. The need for least privilege enforcement and export/search features adds technical and process complexity, warranting multiple subtasks."
