Guidelines

- Keep only README.md as primary project documentation; remove or merge other markdown files unless absolutely critical (e.g., compliance or legal docs).
- Maintain a dedicated PLANNING.md file for continuous progress tracking and planning.
- Carefully consider and plan for every edge case when architecting any feature or fix.
- Keep tasks simple and straightforward to maintain clarity and avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Monitor the terminal closely during execution and prioritize fixing errors based on user directions. Skip lint warnings at early stages if required.
- Perform thorough testing only after fixes and features are fully implemented and error-free.
- Update all relevant documentation promptly and comprehensively after completing any task.
- Adhere to honesty and impartiality in decision-making throughout the project cycle.
- Double-check code, tests, and documentation before marking any task as complete.
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages referencing task or issue identifiers.
- Ensure peer review or self-review is done before finalizing tasks.
- Clean up branches, PRs, or temporary files post-merge to keep repository uncluttered.
- Leverage the use of mcp tools when applicable to enhance productivity and maintain consistency.
- Do not create markdown files for minor notes; consolidate them into existing documentation or project management tools.
